# nw2s::bx

This is an update to the nw2s::b. Most of the ICs are no longer available. I'm starting with an update that allows you to build an SMT PCB that supports most of the functionality. I may update to include support for some other microcontrollers as well as they are pretty easy to support and have boards build for to suit your favorite.
